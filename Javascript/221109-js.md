### What is '??'
- '??' returns the first argument if it's not null/undefined. Otherwise, the second one.
Example:
```
const username = null ? 'MJ';
console.log (username); // MJ
``` 

### What is different from using '||'?
- The nullish coalescing operator “??” acts very similar to the operator “||,” except that it doesn’t use “truthy” when evaluating the operator.
- Instead, it uses the definition of “nullish,” which means that the value is strictly equal to null or undefined.

For instance:
```
let response = {
	number : 0
 }
let number = response.number || 1;
console.log(number) // 1
```

```
let response = {
	number : 0
 }
let number = response.number ?? 1;
console.log(number) // 0
```

key points:
1. With operator “||” if the first operand is truthy, it evaluates to the first operand.
```
console.log(false || true) // true
console.log(false ?? true) // false
```

2. Zero is evaluated as a falsy value.
```
console.log(0 || 1) //1
console.log(0 ?? 1) //0
```

3. Empty string “” is also evaluated as a falsy value
```
console.log('' || 'MJ!') //MJ      
console.log('' ?? 'MJ') //''
```

4. If you check with the undefined or null it will be same
```
console.log(undefined || 10) // 10
console.log(undefined ?? 10) // 10
console.log(null || 100) // 100
console.log(null ?? 100) // 100
```

### Using ?? with && or ||  
- It is not possible to use ?? together with && and || operators, unless the precedence is explicitly specified with parentheses.
For instance:
```
let x = 1 && 2 ?? 3; // Syntax error
```
For instance:
```
let x = (1 && 2) ?? 3; // Works

alert(x); // 2
```
