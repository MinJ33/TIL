### Methods examples
```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

// create a function and assign it to the property user.sayHi of the object
user.sayHi = function() {
  alert("Hello!");
};

user.sayHi(); // Hello!
```
- A function that is a property of an object is called its method

Method shorthand:
```
// these objects do the same

user = {
  sayHi: function() {
    alert("Hello");
  }
};

// can simply just remove "function"
user = {
  sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
    alert("Hello");
  }
};
```

### "this" in methods
- In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the object that we're currently working with
- A method is basically just a function that's inside an object
```
class Car{

  constructor(make, model, year, color){
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    this.color = color;
  }

  drive(){
    console.log("You drive the",this.model);
  }
  brake(){
    console.log("You step on the",this.model+"'s brakes!");
  }
}

let car1 = new Car("Ford", "Mustang", 2022, "red");
let car2 = new Car("Chevy", "Corvette", 2021, "blue");

car1.drive();
car2.brake();

//console.log(this);
```

### "this" is not bound
- In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”.
- However, the greater flexibility creates more possibilities for mistakes.

For instance:
```
let user = { name: "John" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

function sayHi() {
  alert( this.name );
}

// use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f(); // John  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)
````


### Arrow functions have no "this"
- Unlike normal functions, arrow functions do not have their own `this`.
- If you use `this` inside the arrow function, this retrieves the value from the outside.

For instance:
```
let user = {
  firstName: "Ilya",
  sayHi() {
    let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
    arrow();
  }
};

user.sayHi(); // Ilya
```

### Summary
- Functions that are stored in object properties are called “methods”.
- Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().
- Methods can reference the object as this.

The value of this is defined at run-time.
- When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is called.
- A function can be copied between objects.
- When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the call is object.


## Tasks
---
Q. Using "this" in object literal- What is the result of accessing its `ref`? Why?

```
'use strict';

function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: this
  };
}

let user = makeUser();

alert( user.ref.name ); // What's the result?
```
- It will give you an error because the `this` internal makeUser() value is not defined because it is called as a function.

Then how can we make this code work?
```
// my soln
'use strict';

function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref: function() {
      console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}`)
    }
  }
}
makeUser().ref();  // Hello, I'm John
```
- What's the issue if I solve in this way?
- I wrote the code above by referring to following code:
```
const user = {
	name: 'Mike',
    sayHello: function() {
    	console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}`);
        }
     }
 user.sayHello(); // Hello, I'm Mike.
```

```
// Solution in expected format
function makeUser() {
  return {
    name: "John",
    ref() {
      return this;
    }
  };
}

let user = makeUser();

alert( user.ref().name ); // John
```
- user.ref() is a method and the value of `this` is set to the object before dot .


Q. Create a calculator-Create an object calculator with three methods:
- read() prompts for two values and saves them as object properties with names a and b respectively.
- sum() returns the sum of saved values.
- mul() multiplies saved values and returns the result.


```
// my soln 

let calculator = {
  sum() {
    return this.a + this.b;
  },

  mul() {
    return this.a * this.b;
  },

  read() {
    this.a = prompt('a?', 0);
    this.b = prompt('b?', 0);
  } 
};

calculator.read();
alert( calculator.sum() );
alert( calculator.mul() );
```
- mul() works but sum() is not working.. it gives me two numbers put it together not sum of the values...

```
// Solution in expected format
let calculator = {
  sum() {
    return this.a + this.b;
  },

  mul() {
    return this.a * this.b;
  },

  read() {
    this.a = +prompt('a?', 0);
    this.b = +prompt('b?', 0);
  } 
};

calculator.read();
alert( calculator.sum() );
alert( calculator.mul() );
```
- Why should there be a + in front of the prompt? And if converting the type was a problem, why was there no problem with the multi-plication method?
