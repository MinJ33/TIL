### alert
- It shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK”.
```
alert("Hello");
``` 

### prompt
- It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel.
- The function prompt accepts two arguments:

```
result = prompt(title, [default]);
```
For instance:
```
let time = prompt ("what time is it?", [])

alert(`it's ${time}!`)

```

### Summary
- All these methods are modal: they pause script execution and don’t allow the visitor to interact with the rest of the page until the window has been dismissed.

- There are two limitations:
	- The exact location of the modal window is determined by the browser. 
	- The exact look of the window also depends on the browser. We can’t modify it.
