### Objects
- Objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities
- A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.
- An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. 
- A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (aka “property name”), and value can be anything.
- An empty object can be created using one of two syntaxes:
```
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax
```

### Literals and properties
- We can quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces.
Syntax:
```
let user = {     // an object
  name: "John",  // by key "name" store value "John"
  age: 30        // by key "age" store value 30
};
```

- We can add, remove and read files

For instance:
```
// add a boolean one
user.isAdmin = true;

// delete age property
delete user.age;
```

- multiword property name must be quoted
```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  "likes birds": true, // The last property in the list may end with a comma
};
```

### Square brackets
- As we discussed above, the dot access doesn’t work for multiword properties.
- But there's an alternative “square bracket notation” that works with any string:

For instance:
```
let user = {};

// set
user["likes birds"] = true;

// get
alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete
delete user["likes birds"];
```

- The variable `key` may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to `access the property`.
```
let user = {
  name: "MJ",
  age: 80,
  height: 180,

};

let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?", "name");
 
// access by variable
alert( user[key] ); // MJ (if enter "name"), (user.key) cannot be used
````


### Property value shorthand
- Instead of name:name we can just write name, 
like this:

```
// properties have the same names as variables
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    // ...other properties
  };
}

let user = makeUser("John", 30);
alert(user.name); // John

// property value shorthand to make it shorter
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name, // same as name: name
    age,  // same as age: age
    // ...
  };
}
```

### The "for..in" loop
- To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: for..in.
Syntax:
```
for (key in object) {
  // executes the body for each key among object properties
}
```
For instance:
```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};

for (let key in user) {
  // keys
  alert( key );  // name, age, isAdmin
  // values for the keys
  alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true
}
```
```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith"
};
user.age = 25; // add one more

// non-integer properties are listed in the creation order
for (let prop in user) {
  alert( prop ); // name, surname, age
}
```

### Summary
- `Objects` are associative arrays with several special features. 
	- They store properties (key-value pairs)
	- Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings). 
    - Values can be of any type.

- We can access a propery by:
	- The dot notation: obj.property.
	- Square brackets notation obj["property"]. 
    	- Square brackets allow taking the key from a variable, like obj[varWithKey].

## Tasks
---
Q. Hello, object- Write the code, one line for each action:

1. Create an empty object user.
2. Add the property name with the value John.
3. Add the property surname with the value Smith.
4. Change the value of the name to Pete.
5. Remove the property name from the object.

```
// my soln 
let user = {} // 1
    user.name = "John" // 2
    user.surname = "Smith" // 3
    user.name = "Pete" // 4
    delete user.name // 5
```

Q. Check for emptiness- Write the function isEmpty(obj) which returns true if the object has no properties, false otherwise.

```
let schedule = {};

alert( isEmpty(schedule) ); // true

schedule["8:30"] = "get up";

alert( isEmpty(schedule) ); // false
```
My mind's gone blank and this was the best anwser that I can think of.
```
// my soln
function isEmpty(obj){
  if (obj === undefined){ // no properties
    return true; // returns true
  } else {
    return false;  // otherwise returns false
  }
} 
```

```
// Solution in expected format
function isEmpty(obj) {
  for (let key in obj) {
    // if the loop has started, there is a property
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```
- I totally forgot about the "for..in" loop..... 
It is a special form of the loop that executes the body for each key among object properties!
As an example, let's output all properties of schedule:
```
let schedule = {
  "8:30": "Wake up",
  "10:00": "get up",
  "11:30": "take a nap", 
}; 

  for (let keys in schedule){
    alert(keys) // 8:30, 10:00, 11:30
    alert(schedule[keys]) // Wake up, get up, take a nap
  }
```

Q. Sum object properties- We have an object storing salaries of our team
- Write the code to sum all salaries and store in the variable sum.
- If salaries is empty, then the result must be 0.
```
let salaries = {
  John: 100,
  Ann: 160,
  Pete: 130
}
```

```
// My soln
let salaries = {
  John: 100,
  Ann: 160,
  Pete: 130
};

let sum = 0 ;
for (let keys in salaries) {
  sum = salaries.John + salaries.Ann + salaries.Pete;
  alert(sum)
}
```
- So... My code gives 390 but definitely this is not correct because it alerts 390 three times and shows warning on keys. Let's check the answer:

```
let salaries = {
  John: 100,
  Ann: 160,
  Pete: 130
};

let sum = 0;
for (let key in salaries) {
  sum += salaries[key]; // AH  
}

alert(sum); // 390
```
