### Objects
- Objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities
- A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.
- An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. 
- A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (aka “property name”), and value can be anything.
- An empty object can be created using one of two syntaxes:
```
let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax
```

### Literals and properties
- We can quickly create objects with properties inside the curly braces.
Syntax:
```
let user = {     // an object
  name: "John",  // by key "name" store value "John"
  age: 30        // by key "age" store value 30
};
```

- We can add, remove and read files

For instance:
```
// add a boolean one
user.isAdmin = true;

// delete age property
delete user.age;
```

- multiword property name must be quoted
```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  "likes birds": true, // The last property in the list may end with a comma
};
```

### Square brackets
- As we discussed above, the dot access doesn’t work for multiword properties.
- But there's an alternative “square bracket notation” that works with any string:

For instance:
```
let user = {};

// set
user["likes birds"] = true;

// get
alert(user["likes birds"]); // true

// delete
delete user["likes birds"];
```

- The variable `key` may be calculated at run-time or depend on the user input. And then we use it to `access the property`.
```
let user = {
  name: "MJ",
  age: 80,
  height: 180,

};

let key = prompt("What do you want to know about the user?", "name");
 
// access by variable
alert( user[key] ); // MJ (if enter "name"), (user.key) cannot be used
````


### Property value shorthand
- Instead of name:name we can just write name, 
like this:

```
// properties have the same names as variables
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    // ...other properties
  };
}

let user = makeUser("John", 30);
alert(user.name); // John

// property value shorthand to make it shorter
function makeUser(name, age) {
  return {
    name, // same as name: name
    age,  // same as age: age
    // ...
  };
}
```

### The "for..in" loop
- To walk over all keys of an object, there exists a special form of the loop: for..in.
Syntax:
```
for (key in object) {
  // executes the body for each key among object properties
}
```
For instance:
```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isAdmin: true
};

for (let key in user) {
  // keys
  alert( key );  // name, age, isAdmin
  // values for the keys
  alert( user[key] ); // John, 30, true
}
```
```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  surname: "Smith"
};
user.age = 25; // add one more

// non-integer properties are listed in the creation order
for (let prop in user) {
  alert( prop ); // name, surname, age
}
```

### Summary
- `Objects` are associative arrays with several special features. 
	- They store properties (key-value pairs)
	- Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings). 
    - Values can be of any type.

- We can access a propery by:
	- The dot notation: obj.property.
	- Square brackets notation obj["property"]. 
    	- Square brackets allow taking the key from a variable, like obj[varWithKey].
