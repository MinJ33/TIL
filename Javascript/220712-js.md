## Learned
1. The “while” loop
2. The “do…while” loop
3. The “for” loop
4. The "Break" Statement
5. The "Continue" Statement

**The “while” loop**
- syntax
```
while (condition) {
  // code
  // so-called "loop body"
}
```
- While the condition is `truthy`, the code from the loop body is executed
For instance:
```
let i = 3;
while (i) { // show 3, then 2, then 1. When i becomes 0 the loop stops cuz the condition becomes falsy.
  alert( i );
  i--;
}
```

TIP!
- Curly braces are not required for a single-line body
```
let i = 3;
while (i) alert(i--);
```

**The “do…while” loop**
- syntax
```
do {
  // loop body
} while (condition);
```
- do...while loop is similar to the while loop. The only difference is that in do…while loop, the body of loop is executed `at least once`.

For instance:
```
let i = 0;
do {
  alert( i ); // shows 0, then 1, then 2
  i++;
} while (i < 3);
```

**The “for” loop**
- syntax
```
for (begin; condition; step) {
  // ... loop body ...
}
```

For instance: 
```
// for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) alert(i)

// run begin
let i = 0
// if condition → run body and run step
if (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ }
// if condition → run body and run step
if (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ }
// if condition → run body and run step
if (i < 3) { alert(i); i++ }
// ...finish, because now i == 3
```

**The Break Statement**
- It is possible to force the exit at any time using the special break directive.

For instance:
```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) { break; } 
  alert ("The number is " + i ) // shows 0,1,2 then the break statement ends the loop when the i reaches to 3 
}
```

**The Continue Statement**
- The continue statement `breaks one iteration` (in the loop) in `specified condition`, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

For instance:
```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) { continue; }
  if (i === 6) {break;}
 alert( "The number is " + i) shows 0, 1, 2, skips 3 and then continues the loop till break statment ends the loop (i === 6)
}
```

### Summary : 3 types of loops
- while : The condition is checked before each iteration.
- do..while : The condition is checked after each iteration.
- for (;;) : The condition is checked before each iteration, additional settings available.


## Tasks
---
Q. Output even numbers in the loop- Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10.
```
for (let i = 1;  i <= 10; i++){
  if ( i % 2 === 0) {
    alert (i)
  }
}
```
