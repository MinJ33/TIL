### Object references and copying
- One of the fundamental differences of objects vs primitives is that
	- `objects` are stored and copied `by reference`
	-  `primitive` values: strings, numbers, booleans, etc – are always copied `as a whole value`.
	- `When an object variable is copied, the reference is copied, but the object itself is not duplicated.`
For instance:
```
let user = { name: "John" };

let admin = user; // copy the reference
```

	- We can use either variable to access the object and modify its contents:
For instance:
```
let user = { name: 'John' };

let admin = user;

admin.name = 'Pete'; // changed by the "admin" reference

alert(user.name); // 'Pete', changes are seen from the "user" reference
```

### Comparison by reference
- Two objects are equal only if they are the same object.
For instance:
```
let a = {};
let b = a; // copy the reference

alert( a == b ); // true, both variables reference the same object
alert( a === b ); // true
```

- and this two independent objects are not equal, even though they look the same
```
let a = {};
let b = {}; // two independent objects

alert( a == b ); // false
```

### Nested cloning

For instance:
```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50
  }
};

alert( user.sizes.height ); // 182
```

- it’s not enough to copy `clone.sizes = user.sizes`, because 	`user.sizes` is an object, and will be copied by reference, so clone and user will share the same sizes:
```
let user = {
  name: "John",
  sizes: {
    height: 182,
    width: 50
  }
};

let clone = Object.assign({}, user);

alert( user.sizes === clone.sizes ); // true, same object

// user and clone share sizes
user.sizes.width = 60;    // change a property from one place
alert(clone.sizes.width); // 60, get the result from the other one
```


### Summary
- Objects are assigned and copied by reference
- So copying such a variable or passing it as a function argument copies that reference, not the object itself.
